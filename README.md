// Reasons as to why my project is the best

<p>
  With the simpliest of the designs and scripting codes, loading the page and acquiring data from the web is much easier.
  I also provide a catchy title "myTabi Weather" which actually means, "My TRAVEL Weather" to add more approach with the specific users of my web app.
  All codes are written clear and precise with also the observance of different guidelines in coding.
  I also included comments that would also help other developers to understand how I write up my codes and also to classify each part of my app.
  Thus, I am confident to say that my project is the best because, I did write up codes as to how much I have garnered my ideas so does to understand scripts that I just   have seen for the first time that helps me also to assess as to where my weaknesses are in scripting language.
